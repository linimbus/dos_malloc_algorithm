# dos_malloc_algorithm

## Project Overview
The `dos_malloc_algorithm` is a memory management system designed to simulate and analyze the behavior of dynamic memory allocation in a DOS-like environment. This project provides a detailed implementation of a custom `malloc` and `free` function, along with a comprehensive analysis of memory fragmentation, allocation efficiency, and performance metrics.

## Key Features
- **Custom Memory Allocation**: Implements a custom `malloc` function to allocate memory blocks dynamically.
- **Memory Deallocation**: Provides a `free` function to release allocated memory and manage memory fragmentation.
- **Fragmentation Analysis**: Includes tools to analyze and visualize memory fragmentation over time.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures and reports on allocation and deallocation performance, including time complexity and memory usage.

## Code Analysis
The `main.c` file contains the core implementation of the memory allocation algorithm. Below is a brief overview of the key components:
